# Fake-News-Detection

• The objective of this project is to analyze fake news articles by classifying them into "fake" or "not fake" categories using various machine learning algorithms, specifically the Complement Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models. The project implements text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words, to prepare the data for analysis.

• The important libraries used in this project are: pandas, matplotlib, plotly.express, sklearn.naive_bayes, sklearn.metrics, wordcloud, nltk, re, string, nltk.corpus, nltk.tokenize, nltk.stem, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.feature_extraction.text, and collections.
